# Intro to 3D with Qt Design Studio

This is the repo for the 3D with Qt Design Studio Course on Qt Academy.

## Getting Started
- Navigate to the root folder and open the `Intro3DQtDesignStudio.qmlproject` file with Qt Design Studio. You will be greeted with the final application based on an ste;s seen in the course.
- Don't worry we will guide you through the demonstrations!
- We will explore the power of 3D with Qt Design Studio.

## Instructions
To get started with this project, you will need to have Qt Design Studio installed on your computer. You can download Qt Design Studio from the [Qt.io website](qt.io).


Once you have Qt Design Studio installed, open the `Intro-3D-Qt-Design-Studio` folder in Qt Design Studio. You can do this by opening Qt Design Studio selecting File > Open File or Project, and then navigating to the folder.
